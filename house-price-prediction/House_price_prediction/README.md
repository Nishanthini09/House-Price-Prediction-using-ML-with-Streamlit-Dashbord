##House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost algorithm, on the Paris house price dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has been performed to better understand the dataset and its features.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Paris house price dataset, which contains information about various houses in Paris and their corresponding prices.
Technologies Used

    Python
    Streamlit
    scikit-learn
    XGBoost

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA has been conducted to explore the dataset. This includes:

    Analyzing the distribution of house prices
    Identifying outliers
    Understanding the relationships between different features

#XGBoost Model
The XGBoost algorithm has been used to train the machine learning model for house price prediction. XGBoost is known for its performance and efficiency in handling large datasets.

#Results
The trained model achieved an R-score of 0.99 on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting house prices.

#Deployment
The application is deployed using Streamlit. You can access it here: House Price Prediction App
